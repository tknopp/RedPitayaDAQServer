A step can be marked such that during its duration the signal is set to 0. Furthermore, a step can be marked such that it triggers the ramp down.

The ramp up sequence is moved to the FPGA LUT at the acquisition start, followed by the regular sequence. Afterwards the ramp down sequence is started and during its execution the ramp down flag is set. Steps can also be marked to resync the fast DACs. During a resync, the signals are set to 0 and afterwards start again with their set phase and frequency.
