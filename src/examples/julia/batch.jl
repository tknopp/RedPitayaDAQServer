# All commands to the RedPitaya have a reply. Usually this reply is returned by the respective function.
# This means a function can only return upon receiving its reply.
# If a fast configuration of the RedPitaya is important and the commands don't depend on  the previous reply,
# then it is possible to first send all commands before reading all replies in the correct order.

# Here we show simple.jl but configure the RedPitaya in a "batch". We use do-syntax for the function and 
# macros to fill the batch, but it is also possible to do the same manually:
# batch = ScpiBatch()
# push!(batch, serverMode! => (CONFIGURATION))
# ...
# execute!(rp, batch)

# With the do-syntax we open a batch called "batch". This batch gets executed at the end of its block.
# With the @add_batch macro we add a usual command to the given batch to be executed in order
