# RedPitayaDAQServer

This project contains software to be used with the STEMlab 125-14 device (including the Zynq 7020-variant) from [Red Pitaya](https://redpitaya.com/). It allows for continuous generation and measurement of signals with up to 15.625 MS/s, which is not possible with the standard image of the Red Pitaya. In addition, the software allows to synchronize a cluster of multiple Red Pitayas.
